Project Idea


In this quarter, I’m also taking animal physiology ,and there is one experiment in progress which is about the circadian rhythm of cockroaches.
The research topic is to observe how the light with different wavelength affects the circadian rhythm of cockroaches.
There are 4 total experimental group that  3 pairs of cockroaches in each group, 24 total, are exposed to the lights for 12 hours and leave them in the dark another 12 hours.
After that, transfer cockroaches to the T-tube, which sweets and something cockroaches dislike are put on each side.
The way of collecting data is that put cockroach in the tube and measure the time until cockroach reach to the sweet spot. 4 experimental group with 3 pairs each ,so it would be 24 cockroaches data. Moreover, the other variables collecting are light intensity, color filter with different wavelength, and temperature. So there would be 4 variables.
Species are fixed as ‘german cockroach’
The data i need to collect is the measured time of each cockroach, light intensities, wavelength of each cockroaches are exposed, and temperature when the experiment in progress.
I need to arrange those data and analyze to see the differences, and then manipulate and visualize with R program to see the correlations.
Also graph is needed to make the data more visible.
