The final project i'm doing is about to see how circadian rhythm of cockroaches are affected by

wavelengths of the light. There are also many other fact other than wavelength of the light.

Light intensity and temperature could be factors that affect circadian rhythm too.

There are 3 pairs cockroaches in 4 different containers. sex of cockroaches are randomly chosen 

that mating behavior or hatching eggs are not considered as variables affecting circadian rhythm in

this case. In each containers, the lid is covered with color filter and light goes through it to

create colored light with different wavelengths.

Blue ,Green, Red, and grey colored color filters are used in this case.

Cockroaches are exposed to the light 12 hours and leave in dark another 12 hours for one week.

Measuring circadian rhythm is that transfer 3 pairs of cockroaches to the T-tube, which 

i made for experiement that set up sweet spot and repel spot on each side, and measuring time

how long cockroaches take to reach to the sweet spots.

The data I'd like to manipulate is the time, light intensity, and temperature. Some of them

need to be converted using loops and sorted using dictionary on python.

The experiment is still in progress that there possibly will be another variable i need to

consider.

Consequently, the data will indicate the correlation between wavelength of the light and circadian

rhythm of cockroaches.
